#summary Description of UI BPEL's Architecture.

= Introduction =

The UI BPEL extension is a piece of the integrated system for providing User Interfaces (UI) for Web service compositions (WSC) specified through BPEL. The overall architecture of the system is shown in following Figure, which partitions its software components into design time, deployment time, and runtime components.

==Artifacts==

Our approach relies on X artifacts:
 
 * UI-WSC:  an extension of WSC with user interaction activities. To be compliant with current standards, the model is to rely on existing standards: a standard for WSC (e.g. BPEL) and a standard for describing user interfaces (e.g. UsiXML).
 * Abstract user interface (AUI): this model describes the UI independently to any interaction modality (e.g. graphical modal, vocal modal) and computing platform (e.g. PC, smart phone). This model only specifies the UI components, their elements, and the navigation among the components.
 * Concrete user interface (CUI): this model is an adaptation of an AUI to a specific context of use (user preference, environment, and platform). For example, for visually handicapped person, an output abstract component could be transformed to a (concrete) vocal output.

==Method==

Our MDE method consists in 3 main steps:

 * Modeling: where the WSCs are modelized within its user interactions by a designer using the UI-WSC.
 * Transformation: where the AUI is derived by applying transformations to the UI-WSC model. 
 * Adaptation: where the CUI is derived from the AUI and the context of use. Additionally, the user can interact with the CUI through an interpreter, while a runtime component arbitrates the communication between the CUI and the WSC.

= Components =

*Describe what is a component.*

==  Modeling Component ==

Where the WSC can be specified with the user interactions, through a modeling tool. The modelization of the user interactions is materialized by an extension of a WSC language. The extension will be based on two standards: 1) BPEL, the de-facto standard for WSC; and 2) UsiXML link, an emerging standard for describing user interfaces.

==  Deployment Component ==

Where the AUI is derived by applying transformations by the WSC created on the previous component. We adopt the standard proposed by the UsiXML to modelize the AUIs. Additionally, this component is responsible to apply other transformations in order to generate an executable version of the process in BPEL.

==  Runtime Component ==

Where the CUI is generated from the AUI and the context of use. This component can rely on the current works to generate the CUI, such as UsiXML or MARiA link. Additionally, the user can interact with the CUI through an interpreter, while the runtime component arbitrates the communication between the CUI and the WSC.
