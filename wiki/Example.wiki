In the following, we introduce an example of a WSC in order to highlight the need to AUI representation for WSC. Figure 1 presents a simple travel reservations in BEPL. In this WSC, clients are required to provide information about the travel (such as the destination, the departure time, etc.) and to choose the mode of transportation (flight or driving).

The WSC requires the following user interactions: 
 * Data input interactions: input of travel information (1 - InitializingService) and license number (2 - ProvideLicense);
 * Data selection: selection of the mode of transportation: flight or driving (3 - ChoosingMeanOfTransportation);
 * Data output interaction: output of the approval (4 - ConfirmReservation);
 * Interaction by user events: cancellation of the reservation process by the user (5 - CancelationEvent).
