This sub-component is responsible to transform UI-BPEL processes in its AUI description. The activities of BPEL can (1) create new AUI Component: If Activity, While Activity, ForEach Activity, RepeatUntil Activity, Flow Activity, and Pick Activity; (2) create Variable Dependences: Assign Activity, Invoke Activity, DataSelectionUI Activity, continue the recursive creation: Scope Activity and Sequence Activity.

Algorithm:
{{{
If (inputVariable isContained uiVars) 
		or (inputVariable.dependencies 
		     isContained uiVars)
	comp = Create a new Component
 	
c = CreateAbstractDataUI
comp.add(c)
}}}
