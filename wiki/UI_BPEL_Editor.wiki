#summary Description of the UI BPEL Editor.

= Introduction =

In a previous work, we proposed a BPEL extension able to modelize all types of user interactions within WSC processes, called UI-BPEL meta-model. The UI BPEL Editor is a tool able to modelize processes based on this meta-model. Figure 2 presents a screenshot of the tool.

The tabbed properties view allows you to create any user interface for your properties. In addition, you can create user interfaces for elements that do not implement an IPropertySource. Indeed the properties view can be extended to view any data for the selection in your workbench part.
