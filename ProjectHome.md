# Description #

The main objective of this project is to provide User Interfaces (UI) for Web service compositions (WSC). We aim at investigating how user interfaces and their navigation can be derived from the WSC structures (data and control flows). We propose a model-driven engineering approach that provides models and transformational methods that allow deriving and adapting UI for any context of use.

The tool relies on a modelization of user interactions within the WSC, the UI BPEL meta-model. This modelization is compliant with current standards, the model is to rely on existing standards: a standard for WSC (e.g. BPEL) and a standard for describing user interfaces (e.g. UsiXML).
